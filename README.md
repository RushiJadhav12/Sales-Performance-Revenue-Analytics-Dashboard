# Sales Performance & Revenue Analytics Dashboard 

## **1.Executive Summary:**  
This project aims to design a visually rich and high-impact sales dashboard using Tableau to understand, manage, and optimize key sales, profit, and operational trends across various dimensions. The dashboard will focus on key sales-related metrics such as total Revenue, Profit, Quantity sold, and operational metrics like Average Delivery Day. The goal is to empower sales management, regional heads, and executives with data-backed insights to plan better sales strategies, optimize inventory management, and promote efficient employee performance. Sales performance is crucial for business growth and strategic resource allocation. With this dashboard, stakeholders will gain a clearer understanding of regional performance, product profitability, employee efficiency patterns, and emerging sales trends over time —ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and revenue maximization.  

## **2.Problem Statement:**
Background:  
Sales data is often fragmented across various systems (e.g., CRM, ERP), leading to delayed or incomplete reporting. The lack of an integrated, real-time visualization prevents timely responses to market changes, hinders the accurate assessment of employee contribution, and obscures true product profitability.  

Objective:    
To create interactive Tableau dashboards that track sales and profit availability, usage across product lines and sales channels, and the performance impact of top employees over time and geography. The project will also help identify regions with high sales potential and product categories with strong profit margins, guiding strategic inventory and sales focus.  

Scope:  
The initial focus will include: Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) like Revenue ($7.41M), Profit ($1.48M), Quantity (0.06M), Orders (20.0%), and Average Delivery Day (5.499). Detailed sales performance by State and Employee ranking by Sales and Delivery metrics. Time-series analysis for monthly Revenue/Profit and Total Sales by Weekday from 2020-2022. Segmentation and analysis of sales by Product category (e.g., Computers, Dining Furniture) and Sales Channel (Distributor, Online, Wholesale). Geospatial visualization of sales activities across regions.

## **3.Data Sources:**  
Primary Data:  
Sales transactions and order-level data including date, product ID, quantity, sales, profit, employee ID, customer location (State/Region), and sales channel. Order fulfillment and logistics data for calculating Average Delivery Day.   

Secondary Data:   
• Internal CRM/ERP logs for employee data and channel categorization. Geo-mapping data (e.g., Mapbox integration as seen in the visualization) for plotting sales activity.  
• Historical sales forecasts for variance analysis (future enhancement).  

## **4.Methodology:**
Data Integration:  
Raw sales data will be sourced from internal data warehouses or external files and integrated into Tableau using SQL queries and data transformation techniques to ensure clean, structured input for visualization.  

Dashboard Design:  
Key metrics will be visualized using scorecard KPIs, ranked horizontal bar charts, detailed tables (monthly performance), and a time-series bar chart (Total Sales by Weekday). Sales managers and key stakeholders will collaborate in the design phase to prioritize the most impactful indicators and optimize usability.  

Interactivity:   
Interactive slicers and filters will be implemented for Region, Year of Order Date, and Sales Channel to enable drill-down functionality—helping users to explore sales performance at state, monthly, and employee levels.  

## **5.Expected Outcomes:**  
• A visually compelling dashboard to monitor sales revenue, profit, and operational trends in Tableau.  
• Regional and state-level insights into critical performance areas and top sales contributors.   
• Easier performance management and coaching through transparent employee rankings for both sales and delivery efficiency.  
• Clear identification of high-profit product zones and better resource allocation for inventory and marketing efforts.
